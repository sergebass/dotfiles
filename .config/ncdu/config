# Do not cross filesystem boundaries, i.e. only count files and directories
# on the same filesystem as the directory being scanned.
# --one-file-system

# Exclude files that match pattern.
# The files are still displayed by default, but are not counted towards the disk usage statistics.
# This argument can be added multiple times to add more patterns.
# --exclude pattern

# Follow (or not) symlinks and count the size of the file they point to.
# This option does not follow symlinks to directories and will cause each symlinked file to count as a unique file.
# This is different from how hard links are handled.
# The exact counting behavior of this flag is subject to change in the future.
# --follow-symlinks
--no-follow-symlinks

# (Linux only) Include (default) or exclude Linux pseudo filesystems such as /proc (procfs) and /sys (sysfs).
# The complete list of currently known pseudo filesystems is:
# binfmt, bpf, cgroup, cgroup2, debug, devpts, proc, pstore, security, selinux, sys, trace.
# --include-kernfs
--exclude-kernfs

# Include (default) or exclude directories containing CACHEDIR.TAG.
# Excluded cache directories are still displayed, but their contents will not be scanned
# or counted towards the disk usage statistics.  https://bford.info/cachedir/
--include-caches

# Enable/disable extended information mode.
# This will, in addition to the usual file information, also read the ownership,
# permissions and last modification time for each file.
# This will result in higher memory usage (by roughly ~30%) and in a larger output file when exporting.
